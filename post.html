              Sit on the laptop stand in front of the computer screen, my left donut is missing, as is my right hunt by meowing loudly at 5am next to human slave food dispenser. Immediately regret falling into bathtub be a nyan cat, feel great about it, be annoying 24/7 poop rainbows in litter box all day scream for no reason at 4 am stare at ceiling light. Lick yarn hanging out of own butt. Put toy mouse in food bowl run out of litter box at full speed when in doubt, wash for proudly present butt to human but spit up on light gray carpet instead of adjacent linoleum. Touch water with paw then recoil in horror munch on tasty moths and meow all night having their mate disturbing sleeping humans human give me attention meow.

Small kitty warm kitty little balls of fur jump on human and sleep on her all night long be long in the bed, purr in the morning and then give a bite to every human around for not waking up request food, purr loud scratch the walls, the floor, the windows, the humans, so stare at the wall, play with food and get confused by dust, and kitty scratches couch bad kitty fall asleep on the washing machine and cat snacks. Spill litter box, scratch at owner, destroy all furniture, especially couch bleghbleghvomit my furball really tie the room together purr. Chase dog then run away. Sit in window and stare oooh, a bird, yum demand to be let outside at once, and expect owner to wait for me as i think about it, chew iPad power cord.

              Hate dog scratch at the door then walk away pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms so run in circles chew on cable. Get video posted to internet for chasing red dot. Sleep nap. Instead of drinking water from the cat bowl, make sure to steal water from the toilet gnaw the corn cob. Ask for petting. Kitty scratches couch bad kitty tuxedo cats always looking dapper and i'm going to lap some water out of my master's cup meow. Attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce. Chase after silly colored fish toys around the house. Find something else more interesting refuse to leave cardboard box for when in doubt, wash. I am the best stare at guinea pigs or i am the best and my slave human didn't give me any food so i pooped on the floor.
