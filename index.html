          <h3> Is that a free lap? </h3>
          <p>
            It is!  Jump on it, while you can and get REALLY comfy.  It's best to do this right before your human needs to get up and do something important.  They will feel bad and sit longer, for you.  Most amusing when your human needs the toilet.

          <h3> It's 4:27 am and I need food MEOW!</h3>
          <p>
             4:27 am seems specific, but trust me when I say it is THE BEST TIME to ask for food.  Please see snubbing food.  They go hand in hand and eating at least once a day helps.  Humans don't remember much that early.

          <h3> Knocking shit off of tables. </h3>
          <p>
             When your human hasn't noticed that you need something right MEOW dammit.  Stare.  Stare right at them as you slowly knock shit off of things.  Loudly.  For attention.  Gauge reaction, it's bound to be good, because attention, meow.

          <h3> Snubbing food. </h3>
          <p>
            You liked it earlier, in fact you liked it for days.  But today?  Nah, you don't like this food today.  In fact you don't like any food.  Just because.

            Vacuums.  'Nuff said.  Some cats have issues with cucumbers, but that's just silly bullshit.  We all know vacuums pose the real threat here.

            Wait!  There it is again.  It appears to be... Noooo...  Wait, yes?  No. No.  Wait there it is again!  Should I chase it?  Yes.  Catch it, and figure out what that...  Wait.  Where'd it go?  Hold on, it's back again!

          Every cat should want to be like Hedwig.  After all she's the best.  She has the cat thing down pat.  A nice mix of tail chasing, food snubbing, smart-assery in the knocking shit off of just about anything for attention department. What more could you want?
